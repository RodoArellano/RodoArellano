## Â¿Who am I? ðŸ‘€ 
I'm a Data Analyst with a background in Mechanical engineering. And from the moment I started my first database in 2022, I fell in love with the world of data. Later in my studies, I decided to dive fully into the role of an Analyst.

Graduated from the University of Guadalajara as a Mechanical Electrical Engineer, and certified in Data Science by Henry (Bootcamp). Now I am excited to start my professional career and use my knowledge to contribute to the optimization of business processes and decision-making.
